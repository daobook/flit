"Flit is itself packaged using Flit, as are some foundational packaging "
"tools such as ``pep517``. So where can you start if you need to install "
"everything from source?"

"For most users, ``pip`` handles all this automatically. You should only "
"need to deal with this if you're building things entirely from scratch, "
"such as putting Python packages into another package format."

"The key piece is ``flit_core``. This is a package which can build itself "
"using nothing except Python and the standard library. From an unpacked "
"source archive, you can run ``python build_dists.py``, of which the "
"crucial part is::"

"This produces a ``.whl`` wheel file, which you can unzip into your "
"``site-packages`` folder (or equivalent) to make ``flit_core`` available "
"for building other packages. (You could also just copy ``flit_core`` from"
" the source directory, but without the ``.dist-info`` folder, tools like "
"pip won't know that it's installed.)"

"As of version 3.6, flit_core bundles the ``tomli`` TOML parser, to avoid "
"a dependency cycle. If you need to unbundle it, you will need to special-"
"case installing flit_core and/or tomli to get around that cycle."

"I recommend that you get the `build <https://pypi.org/project/build/>`_ "
"and `installer <https://pypi.org/project/installer/>`_ packages (and "
"their dependencies) installed as the goal of the bootstrapping phase. "
"These tools together can be used to install any other Python packages: "
"``build`` to create wheels and ``installer`` to install them."
