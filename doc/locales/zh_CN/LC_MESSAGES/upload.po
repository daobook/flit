"The command ``flit publish`` will upload your package to a package index "
"server. The default settings let you upload to `PyPI "
"<https://pypi.org/>`_, the default Python Package Index, with a single "
"user account."

msgid ""
"If you want to upload to other servers, or with more than one user "
"account, or upload packages from a continuous integration job, you can "
"configure Flit in two main ways:"

"You can create or edit a config file in your home directory, "
"``~/.pypirc`` that will be used by default or you can specify a custom "
"location. This is also used by other Python tools such as `twine "
"<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine>`_."

"For instance, to upload a package to the `Test PyPI server "
"<https://test.pypi.org/>`_ instead of the normal PyPI, use a config file "
"looking like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../upload.rst:40
msgid ""
"You can select an index server from this config file with the "
":option:`--repository` option::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../upload.rst:45
msgid ""
"If you don't use this option, Flit will use the server called ``pypi`` in"
" the config file. If that doesn't exist, it uploads to PyPI at "
"``https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/`` by default."

#: ../../upload.rst:49

"If you publish a package and you don't have a ``.pypirc`` file, Flit will"
" create it to store your username."

#: ../../upload.rst:52
msgid ""
"Flit tries to store your password securely using the `keyring "
"<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring>`_ library. If keyring is not "
"installed, Flit will ask for your password for each upload. "
"Alternatively, you can also manually add your password to the ``.pypirc``"
" file (``password = ...``)"

msgid ""
"You can specify a server to upload to with :envvar:`FLIT_INDEX_URL`, and "
"pass credentials with :envvar:`FLIT_USERNAME` and "
":envvar:`FLIT_PASSWORD`. Environment variables take precedence over the "
"config file, except if you use the :option:`--repository` option to "
"explicitly pick a server from the config file."

"Storing a password in an environment variable is convenient, but it's "
"`easy to accidentally leak it <https://www.diogomonica.com/2017/03/27"
"/why-you-shouldnt-use-env-variables-for-secret-data/>`_. Look out for "
"scripts that helpfully print all environment variables for debugging, and"
" remember that other scripts and libraries you run in that environment "
"have access to your password."
