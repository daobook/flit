"Wheels built by flit are reproducible: if you build from the same source "
"code, you should be able to make wheels that are exactly identical, byte "
"for byte. This is useful for verifying software. For more details, see "
"`reproducible-builds.org <https://reproducible-builds.org/>`__."

"There is a caveat, however: wheels (which are zip files) include the "
"modification timestamp from each file. This will probably be different on"
" each computer, because it indicates when your local copy of the file was"
" written, not when it was changed in version control. These timestamps "
"can be overridden by the environment variable "
":envvar:`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`."

"Flit normalises the permission bits of files copied into a wheel to "
"either 755 (executable) or 644. This means that a file is readable by all"
" users and writable only by the user who owns it."

"The most popular version control systems only track the executable bit, "
"so checking out the same repository on systems with different umasks "
"(e.g. Debian and Fedora) produces files with different permissions. With "
"Flit 0.11 and earlier, this difference would produce non-identical "
"wheels."
